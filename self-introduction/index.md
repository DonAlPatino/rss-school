## Text transcript

Hello, my name is Viacheslav Alpatov. I live in Moscow. I work in IT industry very-very long time. I starter work in 1995 at «Computing Center», how such structures called in soviet time, of Russian University for Humanitarian, when I was a student Department of Informatica in the same university.
A «Computing Center» used students as universal soldiers, we were and tech.support, and network engineers and programmers. But it was good school. There I took part in implementation of first LAN and first Internet access node, because and, it was normal, there were no such things before in the most companies and education centers in Russia. So, you see, I’m not young.
After university, I worked in different Russian and foreign companies in positions of system administrators, project and IT managers. In generally my work was related with infrastructure, business automation and IT management including manage small developer teams.
Of course, I had opportunities to write code, but, unfortunately, I didn’t have enough time to go deeply in software engineering. Usually, when my work was related with business automation, I developed some functionality for business application like Lotus Notes and 1C and their integration with web application. So, I had experience with C, Perl and Python. But without any system approach.
Last 7 years I worked as a system architect, built software infrastructure around big 1C system installations and in result got more time for developing. I run some web projects with C#/.Net and Java Spring. Usually, it was projects for small and middle enterprises. The most were really MVP, but in result they went to prod and work right now. Sometimes such things happens.
So I developed more as backender, hardly a middle, more like a junior level, I think. In generally I use server-side web pages generation with template engine like Razor or Thymeleaf. Of course, I can write HTML, simple JavaScript snippets and know something about CSS. But, as I found, main problem with my projects is the luck of modern and visually pleasing interface. Business people now are very addicted to user friendly application. If something looks not very well at iPhone or MacBook – you can’t sell it. 
So now I try to deep in frontend developing world. This course I consider, for the first, as a prelude to React and Vue courses.
